# PWN Course   

I am a beginner in pwn and I have recently studied some resources for it and collected them as a course. 
The main references are [Nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html) and [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/).  
I will complete the slides and challenges over time. Hope it is useful.
